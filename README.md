Hi, 

I'm work in software development for a living. On my spare time I play the guitar (badly) and dabble in game development. You might see jam entries, some utility libraries and various other small projects here under my profile.

My plan is to at least release a few commercial games, although I'm not quite there yet at the time of writing.

I tend to start too many projects and prototypes compared to what I actually have time for :)

**Languages & tools I use (currently)**:
* [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) - a FOSS game engine for 2d work (which I mostly do)
  * Which means mostly gdscript (sometimes C#) for game programming
* Go, C, Ruby for development for standalone tools / tests
  * Keywords like SDL2, GLFW, OpenGL, Monogame, DragonRuby
* Sometimes dabbling with other languages and tools

**Social media & links**
