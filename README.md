Hi, 

I'm ZebraInFlames.

I'm work in software engineering for a living. On my spare time I play the guitar (badly) and dabble in game development. You might see jam entries, utility libraries and various other small projects here under my profile.

My plan is to at least release a few commercial games, although I'm not quite there yet at the time of writing.
